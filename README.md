# Sinatra At The Movies

## Your Mission

Finish building a very simple movie review application using MVC principles.

### Tips

1. The controller.rb file will be your main Sinatra file. Be sure to check its contents and use the comments within as a guideline. To run your application:
  ```ruby
  ruby controller.rb
  ```
2. The Ruby class located within the "models" folder will give you a good head start. Use it as a foundation and, if possible, try not to modify it at all. It should contain all the functionality neccessary to create the 7 RESTful routes.
